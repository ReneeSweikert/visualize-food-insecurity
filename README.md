## Visualizing Food Insecurity with Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics

This Code Pattern will guide you through downloading, cleaning and visualizing data using different tools. In particular this Code Pattern showcases food insecurity in the US, along with its associated factors.

Often in data science we do a great deal of work to glean insights that have an impact on society or a subset of it and yet, often, we end up not communicating our findings or communicating them ineffectively to non data science audiences. That's where visualizations become the most powerful. By visualizing our insights and predictions, we, as data scientists and data lovers, can make a real impact and educate those around us that might not have had the same opportunity to work on a project of the same subject. By visualizing our findings and those insights that have the most power to do social good, we can bring awareness and maybe even change. This Code Pattern walks you through how to do just that, with IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX), Pandas, Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics.

For this particular Code Pattern, food insecurity throughout the US is focused on. Low access, diet-related diseases, race, poverty, geography and other factors are considered by using open government data. For some context, this problem is a more and more relevant problem for the United States as obesity and diabetes rise and two out of three adult Americans are considered obese, one third of American minors are considered obsese, nearly ten percent of Americans have diabetes and nearly fifty percent of the African American population have heart disease. Even more, cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year, and rising. Native American populations more often than not do not have grocery stores on their reservation... and all of these trends are on the rise. The problem lies not only in low access to fresh produce, but food culture, low education on healthy eating as well as racial and income inequality.

The government data that I use in this Code Pattern has been conveniently combined into a dataset for our use, which you can find in this repo under combined_data.csv. You can find the original, government data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics https://www.bls.gov/cex/ and The United States Department of Agriculture https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/. For the data we use in the second part of this Code Pattern with Watson Analytics, you can go to [df_focusedvalues.csv](https://github.com/IBM/visualize-food-insecurity/blob/visualize-food-insecurity/data/df_focusedvalues.csv) in this repo. You will need a DSX account and a Watson Analytics account to run the duration of this Code Pattern, but you can follow along with the [steps](https://github.com/IBM/visualize-food-insecurity#steps) below!

# Steps

This Code Pattern consists of two activities:

* [Run a Jupyter notebook in the IBM Data Science Experience](#run-a-jupyter-notebook-in-the-ibm-data-science-experience)
* [Anaylze the data in Watson Analytics](#analyze-the-data-in-watson-analytics).

## Run a Jupyter notebook in the IBM Data Science Experience

1. [Sign up for the Data Science Experience](#1-sign-up-for-the-data-science-experience)
2. [Create the notebook](#2-create-the-notebook)
3. [Run the notebook](#3-run-the-notebook)
4. [Save and Share](#4-save-and-share)

### 1. Sign up for the Data Science Experience

Sign up for IBM's [Data Science Experience](http://datascience.ibm.com/). By signing up for the Data Science Experience, two services: ``DSX-Spark`` and ``DSX-ObjectStore`` will be created in your IBM Cloud account. If these services do not exist, or if you are already using them for some other application, you will need to create new instances.

To create these services:
* Login to your [IBM Cloud](http://bluemix.net) account.
* Create your Spark service by selecting the service type [Apache Spark](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/apache-spark). If not already used, name your service ``DSX-Spark``. 
* Create your Object Storage service by selecting the service type [Cloud Object Storage](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/infrastructure/object-storage-group). If not already used, name your service ``DSX-ObjectStorage``.

> Note: When creating your Object Storage service, select the ``Swift`` storage type in order to avoid having to pay an upgrade fee.

Take note of your service names as you will need to select them in the following steps.

### 2. Create the Notebook

> Note: if you would prefer to skip these steps and just follow along by viewing the completed Notebook, simply:
> * View the completed [notebook](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/f3b6ba4b-d983-4e87-a9ff-81a2fe3ba843/view?access_token=d152a743efdebcec1d75c816f1bc99eacb55c783c72e94a4d32f791ddb10096b) and its outputs, as is.
> * While viewing the notebook, you can optionally download it to store for future use.
> * When complete, continue this code pattern by jumping ahead to the [Analyze the data in Watson Analytics](https://github.com/IBM/visualize-food-insecurity/tree/visualize-food-insecurity#analyze-the-data-in-watson-analytics) section.

First you must create a new Project:
* From the [IBM Data Science Experience page](https://apsportal.ibm.com/analytics) either click the ``Get Started`` tab at the top or scroll down to ``Recently updated projects``.
* Click on ``New project`` under ``Recently updated projects``.
* Enter a ``Name`` and optional ``Description``. 
* For ``Spark Service``, select your Apache Spark service name.
* For ``Storage Type``, select the ``Object Storage (Swift API)`` option.
* For ``Target Object Storage Instance``, select your Object Storage service name.
* Click ``Create``.

Create the Notebook:
* Click on your project to open up the project details panel.
* Click ``add notebooks``.
* Click the tab for ``From URL`` and enter a ``Name`` and optional ``Description``.
* For ``Notebook URL`` enter: https://github.com/IBM/visualize-food-insecurity/blob/visualize-food-insecurity/notebooks/Diet-Related-Disease-Exploratory.ipynb
* For ``Spark Service``, select your Apache Spark service name.
* Click ``Create Notebook``.
* You should be able to [run each cell](https://github.com/IBM/visualize-food-insecurity/tree/visualize-food-insecurity#3-run-the-notebook) as is one by one.

![](doc/source/images/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-06%20at%202.23.26%20PM.png)

### 3. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.
* At a scheduled time.
  * Press the `Schedule` button located in the top right section of your notebook
    panel. Here you can schedule your notebook to be executed once at some future
    time, or repeatedly at your specified interval.

### 4. Save and Share

#### How to save your work:

Under the `File` menu, there are several ways to save your notebook:

* `Save` will simply save the current state of your notebook, without any version
  information.
* `Save Version` will save your current state of your notebook with a version tag
  that contains a date and time stamp. Up to 10 versions of your notebook can be
  saved, each one retrievable by selecting the `Revert To Version` menu item.

#### How to share your work:

You can share your notebook by selecting the “Share” button located in the top
right section of your notebook panel. The end result of this action will be a URL
link that will display a “read-only” version of your notebook. You have several
options to specify exactly what you want shared from your notebook:

* `Only text and output`: will remove all code cells from the notebook view.
* `All content excluding sensitive code cells`:  will remove any code cells
  that contain a *sensitive* tag. For example, `# @hidden_cell` is used to protect
  your dashDB credentials from being shared.
* `All content, including code`: displays the notebook as is.
* A variety of `download as` options are also available in the menu.

## Analyze the data in Watson Analytics

1. [Download our new dataframe from DSX](#1-download-our-new-dataframe-from-dsx)
2. [Upload our new dataframe csv into Watson Analytics](#2-upload-our-new-dataframe-csv-into-watson-analytics)
3. [Check out the discoveries that Watson Analytics offers](#3-check-out-the-discoveries-that-watson-analytics-offers)
4. [Suggest different relationships to visualize in the display section of Watson Analytics](#4-suggest-different-relationships-to-visualize-in-the-display-section-of-watson-analytics)

### 1. Download our new dataframe from DSX

The last section of the notebook involves steps to download a dataframe from DSX so that it can be used in Watson Analytics. For convenience, that data frame file (`df_focusdvalues.csv`) is also available in this repo and can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/visualize-food-insecurity/blob/visualize-food-insecurity/data/df_focusedvalues.csv). Download either version of the csv file for use in the following steps. The description of the data values can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/visualize-food-insecurity/blob/mjmyers/data/Variable%20list.xlsx).
    
### 2. Upload our new dataframe csv into Watson Analytics

Once you create an account and login to [IBM Watson Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/watson-analytics) you can upload the csv you just downloaded and use it in your next steps. Do this in the "data" section and push "New data". This should only take a few moments to load.

> Note: If you are using a free trial version of Watson Analytics, the data download may fail due to storage limits. In this case, delete any pre-loaded sample data sets to make room for the `df_focusdvalues.csv` data file.

### 3. Check out the discoveries that Watson Analytics offers

Once you've set up your account, you can see that the Watson plaform has three sections: data, discover and display. You uploaded your data to the "data" section, but now you'll want to go to the "discover" section. Under "discover" you can select your dataframe dataset for use. Once you've selected it, the Watson platform will suggest different insights to visualize. You can move forward with its selections or create your own, or both. You can take a look at mine here (you'll need an account to view): https://ibm.co/2xAlAkq or see the screen shots attached to this repo. You can also go into the "display" section and create a shareable layout like mine (again you'll need an account): https://ibm.co/2A38Kg6.

### 4. Suggest different relationships to visualize in the display section of Watson Analytics

You can see that with these visualizations the user can see the impact of food insecurity by state, geographically distributed and used aid such as reduced school lunches, a map of diabetes by state, a predictive model for food insecurity and diabetes (showcasing the factors that, in combination, suggest a likelihood of food insecurity), drivers of adult diabetes, drivers of food insecurity, the relationship with the frequency of farmers market locations, food insecurity and adult obesity, as well as the relationship between farmers markets, the percent of the population that is Asian, food insecurity and poverty rates.

## Analyzing output

By reviewing our visualizations both in DSX and Watson, we learn that obesity and diabetes almost go hand in hand, along with food insecurity. We can also learn that this seems to be an inequality issue, both in income and race, with Black and Hispanic populations being more heavily impacted by food insecurity and diet-related diseases than those of the White and Asian populations. We can also see that school-aged children who qualify for reduced lunch are more likely obese than not whereas those that have a farm-to-school program are more unlikely to be obese.

Like many data science investigations, this analysis could have a big impact on policy and people's approach to food insecurity in the U.S. What's best is that we can create many projects much like this in a quick time period and share them with others by using Pandas, Pixie Dust as well as Watson's predictive and recommended visualizations.
